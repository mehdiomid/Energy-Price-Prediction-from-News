“Feel” is a concept that, in analysis at least, doesn’t get the respect it deserves. We are all supposed to have only logical, analytical reasons for believing something is about to happen, but if the last few weeks has told us anything it is that when markets get the bit between their teeth, logic is the first casualty.

For comparison, by the time the same thing had happened in 2008, it was clear that the financial system was in trouble and we were heading to an actual recession. Oil has fared even worse, dropping over twenty percent on the same growth fears, price driven supply increase in the U.S., and exceptions to the Iran sanctions.
