The markets reacted to the production cuts immediately. If during the week prior to the announcement of the curtailments the Western Canadian Select (WCS) - WTI CMA differential averaged -32 USD per barrel, it skyrocketed to -11 USD per barrel within four-five working days and has remained more or less at the same level since.
