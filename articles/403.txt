Demand for natural gas is rising fast. The relative clean nature of the fuel, abundance, and geographic distribution make it a good alternative to pollutant coal and intermittent renewables. The coming of age of the LNG industry has boosted the development of a truly global market. In recent years, government policies have been the main driving force of growth: Japan switched off its nuclear power plants after the disaster at Fukushima and switched to gas while China's coal-to-gas policy is having the same effect. In the case of LNG producers, political decisions can also have a major impact. The government’s policy to meet Australia’s rising energy demand is creating uncertainty for international investors during a period when important decisions could be made.   Blessed Australia The world’s population is slated to reach 9.8 billion people in 2050. At the same time, standards of living are also improving leading to a massive growth in energy consumption. In order to keep pace with demand and ensure a habitable planet, the share of fossil fuels in the energy mix needs to decrease significantly. Renewables will provide the lion’s share of the energy with innovative new solutions such as tidal generated electricity. Australia has the capacity to become a world leader in renewables from its current position as an important exporter of fossil fuels.

Australia has thousands of miles of coastline, an abundance of sunshine hours, and large potential for wind energy. Despite the promise of clean energy, fossil fuels make 94 percent of Australia’s electricity production.
