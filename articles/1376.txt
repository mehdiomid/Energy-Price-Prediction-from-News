On Wednesday, prices plunged when the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that in the week-ending July 27, total U.S. inventories rose 3.8 million barrels, while supplies at Cushing fell 1.3 million barrels. Throughout the week, gains were limited and prices pushed lower on concerns about oversupply.
