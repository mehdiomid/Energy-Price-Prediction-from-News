Four BP-chartered supertankers containing a total of 8 million barrels of oil have been held up off China’s east coast over the past two months, in a sign that slower demand from independent refiners may have caught traders off guard, Reuters reported on Friday, citing shipping data and trading and shipping sources. BP was one of the first Western oil firms to start selling crude oil to China’s independent refiners—the so-called teapots—after the small refiners first obtained government-endorsed oil import quotas in 2015. BP regularly ships oil from West Africa to the Shandong province—the home of most of China’s independent refiners. But now demand from the teapots has started to wane due to the higher oil prices and new tax rules that China introduced on March 1. Before that, teapots were known to have used various loopholes in China’s tax regime to underpay, underreport, and even evade taxes. But as of March 1, China introduced new tax regulations and reporting mechanisms in a crackdown on the tax evasion practices of independent refiners. Those new tax regulations have started to stifle the teapots’ profit margins and could limit their purchases of crude oil, potentially affecting demand growth in the world’s largest crude oil importer.

(with) the tax rules biting into margins.” By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:
