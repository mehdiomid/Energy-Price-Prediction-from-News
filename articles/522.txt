China’s march into alternative transport is starting to producer some significant numbers.

EVs and LNG At the end of first-half 2018, China had an estimated 1.65 million passenger car EVs on the road, about 80% of them battery only. Although this represents about half of all EVs globally, it only stacks up to about 36,000 b/d of oil demand displacement. It is the commercial segment where the numbers really start to build. Commercial vehicles drive many more miles on average than passenger cars…
